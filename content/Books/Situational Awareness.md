## Chapter 1: From GPT-4 to AGI: Counting the OOMs

> The author claims that "achieving AGI by 2027 is plausible". 

GPT-2 to GPT-4 took us from ~preschooler to ~smart high-schooler abilities in  4 years. So, we should expect preschooler-to-high-schooler-sized-qualitative jump by 2027 by tracing the trend lines in **three categories of scale ups**:
1. *compute* (~0.5 OOMs/year)
2. *algorithmic efficiencies* (~0.5 OOMs/year)
3. *unhobbling* (from chatbots to agents)

Here are some of the figures used by the author to support his claim.
