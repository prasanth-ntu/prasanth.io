Natural Language Understanding (NLU) encompasses tasks focused on comprehending and interpreting human language in a structured way. It includes:

1. **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined labels (e.g., spam detection).
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying entities like names, places, and dates.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting the emotional tone of text.
4. **Intent Recognition**: Identifying user intent in commands or queries.
5. **Semantic Parsing**: Converting language into structured data, often for databases or code.

NLU models build foundational understanding for language processing and are essential for tasks like chatbots and search engines.
