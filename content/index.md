# üëã Introduction
Hi, I'm Prasanth Thangavel, a Senior Data Scientist with a passion for developing AI-driven solutions for real-time applications. Currently, I enhance user experiences for millions at Grab, Singapore. My expertise spans signal processing, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs). I combine startup leadership and corporate data science experience to drive innovation in dynamic environments. I'm particularly passionate about using advanced AI technologies, especially Generative AI (GenAI), to solve real-world problems.

I find joy ü§ó in analyzing data, building AI/ML models, coding in Python, and sharing my knowledge with others. Recently, I've developed interests in NLP, LLMs, Transformers, and Chatbots, and I enjoy experimenting with these technologies both at work and in my spare time.

# üíº Professional Experience
## Senior Data Scientist
**Mobility at [Grab](https://grab.com/), Singapore** (Nov 2021 ‚Äì Present)
- Developed and optimized various large-scale **ML/DL systems**, improving user conversion, engagement, and retention for millions of Grab users across Southeast Asia (SEA).
- Deployed ML models to reduce cancellations, optimize discounts, and increase ride-sharing adoption.
- Worked on data analysis and simulations for GrabShare (carpooling), reducing launch preparation effort by **90%**.
- Working on various dynamic pricing strategies, leading to significant **BTR/ride conversion and/or revenue increases**.
- DS PIC for productionization of a **self-learning NLP/LLM-based solution** to predict and prevent harmful cancellations, projected to **save millions** annually.
- Conceptualized and developed an early version of **GrabGPT**, a POC for chat/voice-based interface for passengers using state-of-the-art NLP/LLM models.
