Welcome to my blog (a.k.a. digital garden).

# Short introduction
Accomplished Senior Data Scientist with expertise in developing AI-driven solutions for real-time
applications, currently enhancing user experiences for millions at [Grab](https://www.grab.com/sg/), Singapore. Specializing in signal processing, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs), I leverage a unique blend of startup leadership and corporate data science experience to drive innovation in dynamic environments. Passionate about leveraging advanced AI technologies, particularly Generative AI (GenAI), to solve real world problems.

# Long introduction
I find happiness analysing Data, building AI/ML models, coding in Python and teaching/talking them to others! Recently, I grew interests in NLP, LLMs, Transformers, Chatbots, and started playing around with them both at work and in my spare time. 
  
I am a **Data Scientist** with love for number crunching. Skilled in Python and its Data Science stack (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter, TensorFlow, Keras, etc). I teach Python, DA & DS (Data Analytics & Data Science) at General Assembly and as a freelancer. 

I have completed my PhD in a cross-disciplinary platform (AI + MedTech) from [NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore. I also taught ML and DS during my stint in NTU, and conducted various training workshops (sample [1](https://github.com/prasanth-ntu/MLDA-Data-Science),  [2](https://github.com/prasanth-ntu/MLDA-Enthuse-V2)) for a wide range of audience.  
  
Besides, I have worked as CTO of HRTech startup ([jobshine.sg](https://jobshine.sg)) for around 2+ years, where we built chatbot to help blue-collar workers find jobs on the go just by chatting with our friendly bot.  
  
I volunteered as coding instructor at Code in the Community Club, where I taught kids Python and Scratch programming.

Education transformed my life and I want to transform others using education. I firmly believe that 
> *â€œKnowledge grows when shared"*

Now, I am doing my best to share the knowledge through this blog.
